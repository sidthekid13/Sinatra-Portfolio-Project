# Sinatra Portfolio Project
 
## About This Project

This is my Sinatra Portfolio project for Flatiron School! I created this app for the user to be able to keep track of books that they have read and be able to write a little review or their thoughts on the book! It allows the user to signup and login and add/edit/delete posts while they are logged in. Once the user is done using the app they can the log out!

## Installation

Clone this repo into your local environment and run these commands:

    1. ```gem install bundler``` 
    2. ```bundle install```
    3. ```shotgun```

After you have done this, copy and paste the link  that shows up in your terminal after running shotgun and it will take you to the login page!
